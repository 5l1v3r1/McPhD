McPhD
=====
McPhD is a small, simple neutrino Monte Carlo transport package. For more information, please see [this wiki page on Github](https://github.com/losalamos/McPhD/wiki/McPhD). Note on branches: you really want the philox branch, and someday soon, I'll get around to fixing things so that philox is the default/master.

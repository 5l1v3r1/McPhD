This directory contains a moderately capable neutrino Monte Carlo transport code. Physics features include:
* Particles are transported on a spherical, one-dimensional mesh;
* Transport is relativistic: collisions computed in co-moving frame, energy and momentum deposition tallied in the lab frame.
* Analytic cross-sections.
* Counter-based pseudo-random number generator.
* Capable of transporting electron, muon, and tau (anti)neutrinos
* Mesh and fields read from filesÂ (see the data/ directory)

Organization
------------
* Core library in src/
* Driver applications in apps/ (BH-philox(-MPI) are the principle drivers)
* Tools to evaluate performance, garbage collection stats, etc. in utils/
* Tests in tests/

To get started
--------------

1. clone
2. cd McPhD/basic
3. cabal configure -O2
4. cabal build
5. ./dist/build/basic-test/basic-test
